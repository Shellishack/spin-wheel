## Pulse App Template

This is a React full-stack template which you can use to make your own Pulse Editor app. It uses Webpack Module Federation to share modules with Pulse Editor.

For more information about Pulse Editor core and its ecosystem, visit our official [website](https://pulse-editor.com) and [documentation](https://docs.pulse-editor.com).

## Get Started

### Create Pulse Editor extension app using CLI

```bash
# Install Pulse Editor CLI
npm i -g @pulse-editor/cli
# Use CLI to create a React template project (based on this repository)
pulse create
```

### Start development

#### Method 1: Install your extension in Pulse Editor as a dev extension

Run the following to start a dev server locally.

```
npm run dev
```

This will host your extension at http://localhost:3030 (or you can customize the server host in `webpack.config.ts`). Then in Pulse Editor, go to settings and fill in your extension dev server's information to install you new extension. You will need the following:

- dev server: e.g. http://localhost:3030
- extension id: your extension's ID specified in `package.json`
- version: your extension's version specified in `package.json`

#### Method 2: Preview your extension in browser

If you'd like to quickly get started on developing your extension without installing it inside Pulse Editor. You can run a preview dev server that runs in your browser (just like developing React application).

```
npm run preview
```

> Please note that your extension won't be able to use IMC (Inter-Module-Communication) to communicate with Pulse Editor during preview development mode.

### Add extension source code

**Frontend:**  
Add React code inside `/src` to make your custom component(s) for your extension, `main.tsx` is the main entrance for Pulse Editor Extensions.

**Backend:**  
Write server code in `src/server-functions`, each file must have a default export. 

### Pulse Editor libraries

You can use shared utils (like types) from `@pulse-editor/shared-utils`.

You can also use React hooks provided by `@pulse-editor/react-api` to interact with Pulse Editor main process. Some examples are:

- Load/write currently opened file.
- Invoke Pulse Editor agents.
- Use AI models.
- Use agentic tools installed in Pulse Editor.
